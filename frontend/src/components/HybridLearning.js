            <strong>Darul Uloom Online</strong> offers a hybrid mode of study, encompassing both <span className="highlight">synchronous</span> and <span className="highlight">asynchronous</span> learning. In the synchronous mode, students can attend live classes and interact with teachers in a virtual classroom. All live sessions are recorded, forming the basis of the asynchronous platform, which allows students to access these classes at any time and from any location, unrestricted by time zones or work commitments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the asynchronous mode enables students to communicate with teachers via the <strong>Learning Management System (LMS)</strong> to resolve academic queries. This distinctive feature of <strong>Darul Uloom Online</strong> facilitates the dissemination of education globally, ensuring it reaches even the most remote areas.
